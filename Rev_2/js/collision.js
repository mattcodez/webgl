For Y (most common form): y = mx + b

For X (based on the above): x = (y – b) / m

Calculating m (line slope): m = (y2 – y1) / (x2 – x1)

Combine with Pythagorean theorem (C * C = A * A + B * B, where A and B is an X, Y value):

Distance for a ‘y’ intercept point, where y = 1, 2, 3…
distanceY = ((y – b) / m * (y – b) / m) + (y * y)
(ignoring the square root)

Distance for a ‘x’ intercept point, where x = 1, 2, 3…
distanceX = (x * x) + ((mx + b) * (mx + b))
